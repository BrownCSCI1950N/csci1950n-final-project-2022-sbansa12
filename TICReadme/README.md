| Your handin only crashes under exceptional circumstances (edge cases)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ```Completed```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Your engine must draw the current screen on every “draw” event (originating from support code). Each screen must be able to define the way in which it is drawn independently from other screens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ```Look in tic/screens to see all the different screens and their onDraw methods.```                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Your engine must be able to process mouse events (originating from support code) and allow each screen to define how they are handled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ```Look in tic/screens to see all the different screens and them overriding the mouse event functions.```                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Your engine must be able to process keyboard events (originating from the support code) and allow each screen to define how they are handled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ```Look in tic/screens to see all the different screens and them overriding the keyboard event functions.```                                                                                                                                                              |
| Your current screen must update itself on every “tick” event (originating from the support code)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ```Look in engine/Application to see current screen call onTick when event received.```                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Your engine must be able to process resizable windows (originating from support code) and adjust the internal state when the draw area is resized. It must also ensure that size information is preserved when the current screen changes – if the current screen changes after a resize event, the new current screen must be aware of the correct window size as well                                                                      | ```Look in engine/Application onResize to see me change absolute newSize to a scale factor and maintaining aspect ratio```                                                                                                                                                |
| Your engine should have a basic UI toolkit. At a minimum, this toolkit should allow a game to display text and rectangles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ```Look in engine/UI to see UI toolkit made.

| Your engine must have a correct and easily extensible implementation of a button                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ```Look in tic/screens/StartScreen to see me extend a button.```                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| A 3x3 square board must be accessible from the screen once the application is run (either directly or through a menu)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <code>1.

| Your game must implement the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe: two players, X and O, take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols. If a player succeeds in placing three symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, that player wins. If all the squares are filled without either player completing a row, the game is a draw. Both players can be human players: you do not need an AI opponent for this assignment | ```Look in tic/GameScreen and look at checkWin, checkFull, checkDraw, swapPlayer, onMouseClicked to see game rules implemented.```                                                                                                                                        |
