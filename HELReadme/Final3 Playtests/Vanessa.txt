The new game and load buttons (with delete buttons) should all be centered
There is no information about the game and how to play
The back button should be on the top left rather than the top right as we expect an "X" on the top right.
Clicking the save button shouldnt take you back to the level selection screen
it is a bit weird to put the save button in the settings page.
