- some of the things like the text and buttons feel like they are slightly off-center
- the centering of the arrow keys in the control menu is way off
- casing of the text is better weird and inconsistent, especially capitalizing every other word
- background colors for the screen can be nicer, the orange is very bright, though it is good for color blind people
- i like how the jumps are additive so you can do a super big jump
