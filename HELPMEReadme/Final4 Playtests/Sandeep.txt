- add more interesting levels, that provide more of a challenge
- the game glitches at times like if I jump up while also holding the side sometimes it doesn't fully rise
- another glitch is sometimes the tiles seem to overlap if travelling too fast, like falling fast from above
- the settings icon doesnt really look like a proper gear, more like a water wheel
