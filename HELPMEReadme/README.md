## Requirements:
- Saving/Loading Settings/Key Bindings and Levels
  - Levels are loaded from text files stored in helpme/Maps. These text files hold a representation for the tiles for a level, that then gets read in and turned into a gameobject in the world.
  - Settings/Key Bindings are saved and loaded from the helpme/SaveFiles XML files. Users can input custom key bindings for player movements through the in-game menu, that is then saved, and loaded whenever that save file is loaded.
- Friction
  - The logic and explanation behind friction can be found in engine/Components/PhysicsComponent line 184.
