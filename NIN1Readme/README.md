## Primary Requirements:
| Requirement                                                                                                                    | Location in code or steps to view in game |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Your handin must meet all global requirements.                                                                                 | ```Completed```                           |
| Your handin only crashes under exceptional circumstances (edge cases).                                                         | ```Completed```                           |
| Your engine must contain a physics behavior that correctly holds and updates mass, force, impulse, velocity, and acceleration. ||
| Your engine must handle static objects and restitution.                                                                        ||
| Your game must contain a player-controller unit above an immobile platform.                                                    ||
| The player-controller unit must fall when in the air.                                                                          ||
| The player-controller unit must not fall through the platform.                                                                 ||
| The player-controller unit must have a constant downward acceleration.                                                         ||
| The player-controller unit must be able to jump, but only when standing on top of a platform.                                  ||
| Your game must have three objects with visibly different restitution values that can collide with each other.                  ||
| Your game never crashes.                                                                                                       | ```Completed```                           |\

## Secondary Requirements:
| Requirement                                                                                                                           | Location in code or steps to view in game                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Your engine must meet all primary engine requirements.                                                                                | ```Completed```                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Your engine must support collisions/MTVs with convex polygons.                                                                        ||
| Your game must meet all primary game requirements.                                                                                    | ```Completed```                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| The TA debugger must be extended to show collisions and MTVs with convex polygons.                                                    ||
| Your game must include a convex polygon.                                                                                              ||
| Think about fun mechanics you can add to your platformer â€“ allow the player to double jump, slide down walls, jump off of walls, etc. ||
| Add friction (resistance to motion perpendicular to the MTV).                                                                         ||

## Instructions on How to Run:
1) Run the main function in wiz/Main.
2) Wait till the game screen pops up.
3) Click the start button on the title screen.
4) After reading the instructions, click the "X" to close the instructions screen.
5) Click the textbox and enter a seed number, or just click create new world. (2218 is a special number that leads directly to the boss room)
6) Play the game!
7) You can use WASD to move, and SPACE to shoot projectiles. Clicking R will cause the game to restart by going back to the world generation screen.
8) First goal is to find the blue portal
9) Then to defeat the boss
10) Then you can reach the true exit!
