| Your engine must implement an AI library using either behavior trees or goal-oriented action planning. (If using behavior trees: You must include a behavior tree, selector, and sequence class. You must also include a node and action/condition interface.) (If using GOAP: You must include a game state class, an action class/interface, and a condition class/interface. You must be able to search over an action set using a predefined start state and goal condition.) | ```I implemented behavior trees, and the code that relates to it can be found in engine/AI/DecisionTrees.

| Your game must have at least one enemy unit that moves around deterministically (i.e., the same actions by the player result in the same enemy behavior). There must be a visible reaction when the player and item collide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ```The slimes that appear in all levels, except the boss level, move deterministically.

| The enemy unit should use your engineâ€™s AI framework. All of the AI tools included in the engine requirements should be used when constructing your AI. All of the behaviors defined for your enemy should be visible at some point when playing the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ```Look in wiz/WizGame and see createBoss() and createEnemy().
