| Your handin must meet all global requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                    | ```Completed```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Your handin only crashes under exceptional circumstances (edge cases).                                                                                                                                                            | ```Completed```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| The engine must have a “viewport” UI element that draws the GameWorld from a different coordinate system onto the screen coordinate system. The viewport must support panning (translation of the currently viewable game state). | ```Look in engine/UI/Viewport to see the UI element viewport that draws the game world. Look at onKeyPressed to see panning and zooming code.```                                                                                                                                                       |
| Your engine must have a System class that contains GameObjects.                                                                                                                                                                   | ```Look in engine/Systems/System to see a System class that contains GameObjects```                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Your engine must have a class representing the game world. That class must hold at least one system.                                                                                                                              | ```Look in engine/GameWorld to see a class representing a game world and it holds the DrawSystem and TickSystem on creation```                                                                                                                                                                         |
| The viewport should be visible once the game is run (either directly or through a menu). The player must be able to pan the viewport (the viewport cannot display a solid color).                                                 | <code>1. Run the game.</code><br/><code>2. Click the start button</code><br/><code>3. Viewport is on the left.</code><br/><code>4. Use WASD Keys to pan viewport.</code>                                                                                                                               |
| There must be a “unit” visible in the viewport.                                                                                                                                                                                   | <code>1. Run the game.</code><br/><code>2. Click the start button</code><br/><code>3. Click one of the elements on the right hand menu and drag to the left where the viewport is. The unit can be seen in the viewport.</code>                                                                        |
| The “unit” must respond to being clicked (only when the unit itself is clicked).                                                                                                                                                  | <code>1. Run the game.</code><br/><code>2. Click the start button</code><br/><code>3. Click one of the elements on the right hand menu and drag to the left where the viewport is.</code><br/><code>4. You have the full ability to click and move this unit wherever you like in the viewport.</code> |
| The “unit” must be able to be dragged freely.                                                                                                                                                                                     | <code>1. Run the game.</code><br/><code>2. Click the start button</code><br/><code>3. Click one of the elements on the right hand menu and drag to the left where the viewport is.</code><br/><code>4. You have the full ability to click and move this unit wherever you like in the viewport.</code> |
| The “unit” should be drawn and moved using separate components.                                                                                                                                                                   | ```Look into engine/Components and you will see a SpriteComponent that has the draw function filled in where the unit is drawn. You will also see a MouseDragComponent that has the script function filled in where it handles all the mouse drag logic.```                                            |

| Your engine must meet all primary engine requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                        | ```Completed```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| The viewport must support zooming (scaling of the currently viewable GameState). When zooming, the viewport must either keep the center of the game in the same position or keep the location currently under the mouse in the same position. | <code>1.

| The player must be able to zoom the map (make sure the unit still responds to being clicked!).                                                                                                                                                | <code>1.

| There must be a menu from which the player can make a copy of a “unit” by clicking and dragging it, without the original being destroyed or moved.                                                                                            | <code>1.

--------------------------------------------------------------

## Instructions on How to Run:
1) Run the main function in alc/Main.
2) Wait till the game screen pops up.
3) Click the start button on the title screen.
4) You will be brought to the game screen.
5) There is a menu on the right with element names.
6) You can click over an element name in the menu and drag an element of that type into view in the viewport on the left.
7) You can use the WASD keys to pan the viewport
8) You can use the ZX keys to zoom in and out, respectively.
9) Clicking the escape button at any moment causes the game to exit.
